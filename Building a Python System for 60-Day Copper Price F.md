## Building a Python System for 60-Day Copper Price Forecasting

To automate copper price forecasting, news analysis, and recommendation generation as described, you’ll need a modular pipeline. Below is a breakdown of the required components, recommended sources, and implementation tips.

### 1. **Requirements and Functional Modules**

#### **A. Data Acquisition**

- **Copper Price Data**
    - Fetch historical and current copper prices (preferably daily closing prices for at least the last 90 days).
- **News Headlines**
    - Gather recent news articles and headlines related to copper, mining, and global commodities.


#### **B. Data Processing**

- **Price Trend Analysis**
    - Calculate trends, moving averages, and volatility from price data.
- **News Sentiment Analysis**
    - Use NLP to score news sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) regarding copper’s outlook.


#### **C. Forecasting**

- **Price Prediction**
    - Apply time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) for 60-day price forecasting.
- **Recommendation Engine**
    - Combine forecast and sentiment to issue a buy/hold/sell recommendation with rationale.


#### **D. Reporting \& Visualization**

- **Dashboard or Report**
    - Visualize price trends, forecasts, news sentiment, and the final recommendation.


### 2. **Recommended Data Sources**

| Data Type | Sources to Use |
| :-- | :-- |
| Price Data | TradingEconomics, Yahoo Finance, London Metal Exchange |
| News Headlines | Google News API, Bing News API, RSS feeds (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg), X (formerly Twitter) for expert commentary |
| Forecasts/Opinions | Fastmarkets, Capital.com, LongForecast, MINING.COM |

### 3. **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

#### **Step 1: Data Ingestion**

- Use APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, TradingEconomics) to pull copper price data.
- Scrape or query news APIs for recent copper-related headlines.


#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

- Clean and format price data (handle missing values, resample if needed).
- Preprocess news: deduplicate, remove irrelevant articles, extract headline and summary.


#### **Step 3: Trend \& Sentiment Analysis**

- Compute moving averages (e.g., 7-day, 30-day), price momentum, and volatility.
- Apply pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy) to news headlines.


#### **Step 4: Forecasting**

- Fit a time series model (Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM) to historical prices to predict the next 60 days.
- Optionally, use LLMs (e.g., Groq) to summarize both price trends and news sentiment for contextual reasoning.


#### **Step 5: Recommendation Logic**

- Define rules or use an LLM to combine price forecast and sentiment:
    - **Buy**: Upward trend, positive sentiment, supply constraints.
    - **Hold**: Sideways trend, mixed sentiment.
    - **Sell**: Downward trend, negative sentiment, signs of oversupply or demand drop.


#### **Step 6: Reporting**

- Generate a report or dashboard (using Streamlit, Dash, or Jupyter Notebook) showing:
    - Price chart (historical + forecast)
    - News sentiment summary
    - Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation with reasoning


### 4. **Python Libraries \& Tools**

- **Data Collection:** `yfinance`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `newsapi-python`
- **Data Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Time Series Forecasting:** `prophet`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `torch` (for LSTM)
- **NLP/Sentiment:** `transformers` (Hugging Face), `spaCy`, `nltk`, `textblob`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `streamlit`
- **Orchestration:** `LangGraph` (for agent flows), `FastAPI` (optional, for API endpoints)


### 5. **Example Pipeline Structure**

```python
# Pseudocode outline
1. Fetch price data (last 90 days)
2. Fetch and preprocess news headlines (last 30 days)
3. Analyze price trend (moving averages, volatility)
4. Sentiment analysis on news
5. Forecast next 60 days of prices (e.g., with Prophet)
6. Combine forecast & sentiment for recommendation
7. Output results (dashboard/report)
```


### 6. **Key Implementation Tips**

- **Automate Data Refresh:** Schedule scripts to update prices and news daily.
- **Handle Exceptions:** Robust error handling for API failures or missing data.
- **Transparency:** Log model predictions and recommendation rationales for auditability.
- **Scalability:** Start with a single commodity (copper), then modularize for others.


### 7. **Sample Data Sources**

- **TradingEconomics:** Historical prices, forecasts, economic indicators.
- **Yahoo Finance:** Free historical price data.
- **London Metal Exchange:** Official copper prices and reports.
- **Google News API/Bing News API:** Aggregated news headlines.
- **Fastmarkets, MINING.COM, Capital.com:** Industry analysis and forecasts.


### 8. **References for Market Insights**

- Fastmarkets: Bullish long-term copper outlook, driven by green energy and infrastructure demand.
- LongForecast: Monthly copper price predictions, showing upward trends.
- X (Twitter): Real-time expert sentiment and supply/demand commentary.

By following this modular approach, you can develop a robust Python-based system to forecast copper prices, analyze market sentiment, and generate actionable recommendations—mirroring the workflow of expert analysts and leveraging the most relevant data sources.
